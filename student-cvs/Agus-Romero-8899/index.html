        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone!</p>
        <p>
          My name is Agustina Romero, and I've been working as a nurse since 2015. I obtained my degree from the Universidad Autónoma de Entre Ríos (UADER), where I gained solid academic and technical training in the healthcare field. Currently, I'm also studying the second year of the Systems Engineering degree program at the Universidad Nacional de Entre Ríos (UNER) to expand my knowledge in the technology field.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my career as a nurse, I've gained extensive experience in various healthcare settings. I've learned the importance of teamwork and adaptability, and I possess key skills such as patient care, empathy, and effective communication. These skills are transferable to any workplace, including programming, where collaboration, learning, and adaptability are crucial.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my nursing experience, I'm participating in a full-stack bootcamp taught by Guillermo Rodas to expand my skills and explore new career opportunities. I believe that this experience will allow me to combine my passion for technology with my healthcare background and create innovative solutions to improve people's lives.
